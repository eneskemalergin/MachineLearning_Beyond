# Machine Learning in H2O

"H2O is open-source software for big-data analysis. It is produced by the company H2O.ai (formerly 0xdata), which launched in 2011 in Silicon Valley. H2O allows users to fit thousands of potential models as part of discovering patterns in data."

H2O is also claiming to be the world's leading open source deep learning platform. So I wanted to store some snippets from the book called [Practical Machine Learning with H2O](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920053170.do), while I learn how to use this tool.
