### Assignment 1

Perceptron Algorithm.


In learn_perceptron.lua complete the two sections where it says ‘Your code here’.

``` sh
 if (activation[{ 1, 1}] >= 0) then
        -----------------
        -- YOUR CODE HERE
        -----------------
 end
```


You can change which dataset to load in main.lua

``` sh
 -- Choose between dataset1 to dataset4.
 dataset = 'data/dataset1.mat';
```

If you have gfx.js running you will see the data plotted at [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/)
