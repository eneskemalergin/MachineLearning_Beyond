    "Let's examine how we will represent a hypothesis function using neural networks. At a very simple level, neurons are basically computational units that take inputs (__dendrites__) as electrical inputs (called \"spikes\") that are channeled to outputs (__axons__). In our model, our dendrites are like the input features $x_1\\cdots x_n$, and the output is the result of our hypothesis function. In this model our x0 input node is sometimes called the \"bias unit.\" It is always equal to 1. In neural networks, we use the same logistic function as in classification, $\\frac{1}{1 + e^{-\\theta^Tx}}$, yet we sometimes call it a sigmoid (logistic) __activation__ function. In this situation, our \"theta\" parameters are sometimes called \"weights\".\n",

    "\n",
    "Our input nodes (layer 1), also known as the \"input layer\", go into another node (layer 2), which finally outputs the hypothesis function, known as the \"output layer\".\n",
    "\n",
    "We can have intermediate layers of nodes between the input and output layers called the \"hidden layers.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we label these intermediate or \"hidden\" layer nodes $a^2_0 \\cdots a^2_n$ and call them \"activation units.\"\n",

    "This is saying that we compute our activation nodes by using a 3×4 matrix of parameters. We apply each row of the parameters to our inputs to obtain the value for one activation node. Our hypothesis output is the logistic function applied to the sum of the values of our activation nodes, which have been multiplied by yet another parameter matrix $\\Theta^{(2)}$ containing the weights for our second layer of nodes.\n",
