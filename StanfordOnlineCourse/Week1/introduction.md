What is Machine Learning?

- The field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.
- A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect t some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.

Any machine learning problem can be assigned to one of two broad classifications:

- Supervised Learning
- Unsupervised Learning

## Supervised Learning
In supervised learning we deal with a dataset that has the right answers, and we know how the correct output look like.

- __Regression:__ We are trying to predict results within a continuous output, meaning that we are trying to map input variables to some continuous function
- __Classification:__ We are instead trying to predict results in a discrete output. In other words, we are trying to map input variables into discrete categories.


## Unsupervised Learning

In unsupervised learning we don't know what is the output look like. We can derive structure from data where we don't necessarily know the effect of the variables.

> With unsupervised learning there is no feedback based on the prediction results.
