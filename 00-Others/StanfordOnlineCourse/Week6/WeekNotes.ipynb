    "Once we have done some trouble shooting for errors in our predictions by:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Getting more training examples\n",
    "- Trying smaller sets of features\n",
    "- Trying additional features\n",
    "- Trying polynomial features\n",
    "- Increasing or decreasing 位\n",
    "\n",
    "We can move on to evaluate our new hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "A hypothesis may have a low error for the training examples but still be inaccurate (because of overfitting). Thus, to evaluate a hypothesis, given a dataset of training examples, we can split up the data into two sets: a **training set** and a **test set**. Typically, the training set consists of 70 % of your data and the test set is the remaining 30 %.\n",
    "\n",
    "The new procedure using these two sets is then:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Learn $\\theta$ and minimize $J_{train}(\\theta)$ using the training set\n",
    "2. Compute the test set error $J_{test}(\\theta)$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The test set error\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For linear regression $J_{test}(\\Theta) = \\dfrac{1}{2m_{test}} \\sum_{i=1}^{m_{test}}(h_\\Theta(x^{(i)}_{test}) - y^{(i)}_{test})^2 $\n",
    "2. For classification ~ Misclassification error (aka 0/1 misclassification error):\n",

    "$$\n",
    "err(h_\\Theta(x),y) = \\begin{matrix} 1 & \\mbox{if } h_\\Theta(x) \\geq 0.5\\ and\\ y = 0\\ or\\ h_\\Theta(x) < 0.5\\ and\\ y = 1\\newline 0 & \\mbox otherwise \\end{matrix}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives us a binary 0 or 1 error result based on a misclassification. The average test error for the test set is:\n",

    "Just because a learning algorithm fits a training set well, that does not mean it is a good hypothesis. It could over fit and as a result your predictions on the test set would be poor. The error of your hypothesis as measured on the data set with which you trained the parameters will be lower than the error on any other data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given many models with different polynomial degrees, we can use a systematic approach to identify the 'best' function. In order to choose the model of your hypothesis, you can test each degree of polynomial and look at the error result.\n",

If a word is to be found in the email, we would assign its respective entry a 1, else if it is not found, that entry would be a 0.

    "The recommended approach to solving machine learning problems is to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Start with a simple algorithm, implement it quickly, and test it early on your cross validation data.\n",
    "- Plot learning curves to decide if more data, more features, etc. are likely to help.\n",

    "\n",
    "For example, assume that we have 500 emails and our algorithm misclassifies a 100 of them. We could manually analyze the 100 emails and categorize them based on what type of emails they are. We could then try to come up with new cues and features that would help us classify these 100 emails correctly. Hence, if most of our misclassified emails are those which try to steal passwords, then we could find some features that are particular to those emails and add them to our model. We could also see how classifying each word according to its root changes our error rate:\n",

    "\n",
    "It is very important to get error results as a single, numerical value. Otherwise it is difficult to assess your algorithm's performance. For example if we use stemming, which is the process of treating the same word with different forms (fail/failing/failed) as one word (fail), and get a 3% error rate instead of 5%, then we should definitely add it to our model. However, if we try to distinguish between upper case and lower case letters and end up getting a 3.2% error rate instead of 3%, then we should avoid using this new feature. Hence, we should try new things, get a numerical value for our error rate, and based on our result decide whether we want to keep the new feature or not."
